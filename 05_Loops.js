// JavaScript Questions for Practice (Loops)

// For Loops:

// 1. Write a for loop that prints even numbers from 2 to 20.
 
// 2. Use a for loop to iterate through an array (numbers) and calculate the sum of all elements.

// 3. Create a program that prints the square of numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop.

// 4. Write a for loop that iterates in reverse, printing even numbers from 10 to 2.

// 5. Use a for loop to iterate through a string (word) and log each character in reverse order.

// While Loops:

// 6. Implement a while loop that prints odd numbers up to 15.
 
// 7. Create a program using a while loop to find the product of numbers from 1 to 5.
 
// 8. Write a while loop that calculates the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 10.

// 9. Use a while loop to find the first prime number greater than 10.

// 10. Implement a program that counts up by 5 from 5 to 50 using a while loop.

// Nested Loops:

// 11. Create a multiplication table for numbers 1 to 5 using nested for loops.

// 12. Write nested loops to generate a pattern, such as a right-angled triangle or a square.

// 13. Implement a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the 8th term using nested loops.

// 14. Create a program that generates a multiplication table for numbers 2 to 4 using nested while loops.

// Loop Control Statements:

// 15. Use the break statement to exit a for loop when a certain condition is met.

// 16. Implement a while loop that skips multiples of 3 using the continue statement.

// 17. Write a program using a labeled loop and the break statement to find a specific value in a 2D array.
